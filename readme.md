# Hi everyone!, I am Anel Hizaguirre
### Lynphex

I'm studying Big Data, Artificial intelligence 
and Machine Learning based in Spain.
I'm improving my skills with Python and learning more
about Git,SQL and more.

I like to work in teams, and I'm also independent. I enjoy write about what 
I'm learning. because I consider it helps me to understand better and maybe 
it helps to others.

Ask me about whatever you want, I really enjoy to help and share.
